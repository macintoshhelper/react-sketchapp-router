# Responsive Devices

This is an example of rendering multiple viewports per screen, and using a layout context provider to have variable column numbers based on the screen size.

You can find more examples at [react-sketchapp: ./examples](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp/tree/master/examples).


## How to use

Download the example or [clone the repo](http://github.com/macintoshhelper/react-sketchapp-examples):

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/macintoshhelper/react-sketchapp-examples/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 react-sketchapp-examples-master/examples/responsive-devices
cd responsive-devices
```

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then, open Sketch and navigate to `Plugins → react-sketchapp: Responsive Devices`

Run with live reloading in Sketch, need a new sketch doc open

```bash
npm run render
```

## The idea behind the example

[`skpm`](https://github.com/skpm/skpm) is the easiest way to build `react-sketchapp` projects - this is a minimal example of it in use.
